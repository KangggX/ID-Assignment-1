#Portfolio for Interactive Development

# Assignment 1 Porfolio
My project, Assignment 1 Porfolio, is about developing a portfolio about myself with the help of Interactive Development tools such as Visual Studio code, Github and Front-end Programming language, HTML & CSS. 
My portfolio consists of 3 different pages and a section.

Firstly, my Home page briefs my future employers about a short introduction of myself. The introduction consists of the college I am currently studying in, and also the Diploma, Immersive Media. The introduction also consists of why I personally love Immersive Media and my passion for it.

Secondly, the Education page displays my Education History in a form of a timeline starting at my very first Primary School all the way to my present state!

Thirdly, the Projects page showcases a few of my projects I have completed during the first semester of year 1 in Immersive Media.

Last but not least, the Contact Me section is available for employers to send me an email if they have any other questions or want to know more about me.

## Design Process

Design Process
When I first started designing this website of mine, I planned to revolve it around 2 main colors, Grey and Green, which are extremely complimentary. The green colour is basically the accent colour of the site and for keywords and selecting actions while the grey colour represents the main background and design of my website. 

On my first page, the Home page, I decided to give an introduction about myself as this is where the initial landing space is located. 

In my Education page, I decided to make a short and basic timeline like feature where it shows the years and progress throughout my educational life so far. The timeline feature was also implemented with the green and grey colours in order to stay uniform throughout. In each milestone of my timeline, I included a short summary of my education status.

In my Projects page, I decided to create it based off a gallery themed page. This means that all my projects would be compressed into uniform boxes and if you were to hover your cursor over each of these boxes, a short summary will pop up from the picture explaining that particular project.

The "Contact Me" page is designed to look simple for exmployer to send an email to me.

Lastly, each and every page have a Green footer located below which consists of my email address, phone number and social media pages.

With all these uniform website structures, I am sure that my employers will be more than happy to be able to navigate around my portfolio easily.

## User Story

 - As an employer, I would like to be able to contact my future employee with convenience, so I can use the convenient Contact Me Section located at the bottom of each page.
 - As an employer, I would like to know more about my employee's passion, so I can read his introduction.
 - As an employer, I would like to know about my employee's education history, so I can know about how he has done in his major exams.
 - As an employer, I would like to know more about my employee's projects, so that I can check whether his work is aligned to my companies requirements.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Education section:
    1. Go to the "Education" page
    2. Resize the browser viewport using the Developer Tools aka Inspect Element
    3. See if timeline is adjusted accordingly to the viewport width such that at every different width, the timeline and its content can be seen clearly without any obstruction

2. Porject gallery:
    1. Go to the "Projects" page
    2. Resize the browser viewport using the Developer Tools aka Inspect Element
    3. See if the gallery is resized based on the viewport
    4. A viewport of less than around 1000px will display a vertical gallery

3. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Me" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears
    5. Resize the browser viewport using the Developer Tools aka Inspect Element
    6. See if each individual input are sized properly based on the viewport
